Mercury ME-DPF24MG photo frame hack by Boris Gjenero <boris.gjenero@gmail.com>
Based on st2205tool-1.4.3 by Jeroen Domburg <jeroen@spritesmods.com>
Released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

The Mercury ME-DPF24MG is a 320x240 portable photo frame based on a Sitronix
chip. This hack allows immediate image display via USB, backlight control,
and LCD power control.

The first firmware page, from 0x0000 to 0x3FFF, is write-protected.
This prevents a hack via interrupt handlers, like in st2205tool. Instead,
the hack is performed via a command that is on a writable firmware page.
The original firmware command only needs to be sent to start running the
hack. It then continues running until the next original firmware command
is received. The hack uses polling and has various optimizations for
maximum performance. Nevertheless, a high frame rate is not attainable
at 320x240x24bpp over USB 1.1.

The tools and hack here originated as st2205tool-1.4.3, but most have been
substantially rewritten. The phack command line syntax has changed. It may
be displayed via "phack -h". Both bgrep and splice work the same way, but
the error checking and handling has been improved. In hackfw.sh, firmware
dumping and flash writing parts have been removed, and the script is only
used for patching firmware. Dumping and flashing should be done manually
via phack. This allows for creating a new hacked firmware without needing
to first flash the original firmware. It also allows you to inspect the
patched firmware before installing it on the device.

The photo frame may be accessed via libst2205 and setpic. The libst2205
here has been altered and it contains an added LCD sleep/wake function,
but it should be compatible with software written for the old libst2205.
Setpic now supports JPEG, PNG and GIF files. It resizes files for the
photo frame, maintaining the aspect ratio. It can also be used for LCD
sleep and wake.
